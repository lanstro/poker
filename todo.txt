todo:

- drag & drop for card sorting
- showdown timer fail - get javascript to post rather than waiting for signal?
- give whole schedule to javascript?
- popup messages for:
	- warning that balance too low
	- welcome/farewell from table
	- forced into sitting out
- fix trailing slashes
- when not signed in, still see sit out / rage quit (cookies issue?)


- better message log - indentation, coloring
- layout collapsing in invalids/folders notification
- rules page
- understand asset pipeline and separate out the page specific stuff
- figure out heroku bug
- use helper to do recover table balances

- AI?
- kickstarter?
